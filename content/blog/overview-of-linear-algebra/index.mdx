This blog post is my note whilte learning Abstract Linear Algebra along the way.
Make sure you are familiar with some math symbols. I will keep updating the content of this page from time to time.

The word “vector” should not be with the confused with arrow representations mostly used in Linear Algebra textbooks.
In this blog post, the word “vector” is being used to describe any element of a vector space.

For simplicity, let $+$ be addition, $-$ substraction, $\times$ multiplication, and $\div$ division.

To be able read through this entire series easily, you should be familiar with some sets of numbers, namely:

- Integer numbers $\mathbb{Z}$
- Real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
- Natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$
- Complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$

I am going to split this blog post into sub-sections so readers will not get overwhelmed while reading.

1. Vector Spaces _(coming soon)_
2. Linear Transformations and Matrices _(coming soon)_
3. Matrix Operations and Systems of Linear Equations _(coming soon)_
4. Determinants _(coming soon)_
5. Diagonalizations _(coming soon)_
6. Inner Product Spaces _(coming soon)_
7. Canonical Forms _(coming soon)_
