Before defining what vector space is, we should know what a group $\mathbb{G}$ and a field $\mathbb{F}$ are.

Let $\mathbb{S}$ be a set of numbers, and $\circ$ an arbitrary operation.
$(\mathbb{S}, \circ)$, or a set of numbers under any arbitrary operation, is considered to be a group $\mathbb{G}$ if
1. The operation is closed, meaning that for all $x,y$ in $\mathbb{S}$ such that $x+y$ is also in $\mathbb{S}$
2. The set has an unique identity, in other words $e + x = x + e = x$
3. Every element in the set has an inverse
4. Associative property exists
