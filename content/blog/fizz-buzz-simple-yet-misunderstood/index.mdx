I am sure everyone has seen Fizz Buzz problem many times before, and thinks it is really easy to solve.
Well, I thought it was easy until I stumbled upon this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc).

In Fizz Buzz, there are two conditions:

- if a number is divisible by 3, print `Fizz`
- if a number is divisible by 5, print `Buzz`

Well, I know everyone would solve the problem like this

```python:title=fizzbuzz.py
int limit = 11

for i in range(1, limit):
  if i % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  if i % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(i)
```

What if you were asked to improve the code above on one of your interview processes?

The code above will be bloated if we keep adding more conditions. Namely,

- if a number is divisible by 3, print `Fizz`
- if a number is divisible by 5, print `Buzz`
- if a number is divisible by 7, print `Boom`
- if a number is divisible by 9, print `Ugh`
- the list keeps going ...

With `if else` paradigm, the solution is going to look like this

```python:title=ifelse-fizzbuzz.py
limit = 11

for i in range(1, limit):
  if i % 3 == 0:
    print("Fizz")
  elif i % 5 == 0:
    print("Buzz")
  elif i % 7 == 0:
    print("Boom")
  elif i % 9 == 0:
    print("Ugh")
  ... # many other conditions
  else:
    print(i)
```

That is a tedious work to do and the code becomes bloated.

However, we can use the **string concatenation** technique to tackle this problem.
The code looks less bloated, but it is still hard-coded.

```python:title=string-concatenation-fizzbuzz.py
limit = 11

for i in range(1, limit):
  string = ''
  if i % 3 == 0:
    string += 'Fizz'
  elif i % 5 == 0:
    string += 'Buzz'
  elif i % 7 == 0:
    string += 'Boom'
  elif i % 9 == 0:
    string += 'Ugh'
  ... # many other conditions

  if(string == ''):
    print(i)
    continue

  print(string)
```

However, **there is a improvised version to solve this one** like the one below

```python:title=fizzbuzz-v2.py
words = [(3, "Fizz"), (5, "Buzz")]
limit = 11

for i in range(1, limit):
  string = ""

  for word in words:
    if(i % word[0] == 0):
      string = string + word[1] + " "

  if(string == ""):
    print(i)
    continue

  print(string)
```

For the solution above, we just have to add the additional conditions in `words` without having to tinker with the for-loop.

Clearly, `fizzbuzz-v3.py` is the most efficient solution so far by comparison.
