This is part 2 of the series on Gradient Descent.

- <Link to="/blog/part-1-gradient-descent">Part 1: Gradient Descent</Link>
- <Link to="/blog/part-3-stochastic-gradient-descent">Part 3: Stochastic Gradient Descent</Link>

Pretty much of the code we are going to use are basically the same like in <Link to="/blog/part-1-gradient-descent">Part 1: Gradient Descent</Link>.
We have to configure the `python:gd()` function so it can update the parameters, namely the intercept and the first coefficient, after some considerable amount of data are seen.
